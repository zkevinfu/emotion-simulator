# AEI (Artificial Emotional Intelligence)

Fancy name for an emotional response simulator  
Which is also a fancy name for a bot that can *feel* 

**Currently Features**  
A modifiers value determines what degree any given stimuli affects AEI emotion levels  
States are hard coded objects with a modifier modifying value 
AEI is created using an 8 dimensional Plutchik Emotion Wheel

**Dimensions:**  
1. fear  
2. anger  
3. sadness  
4. joy  
5. disgust  
6. surprise  
7. trust  
8. anticipation  

 

**--DONE?--**  
Pretty sure the actual AEI class is coming along  
I think the state class is also good?  
Theres a command line for handling input, which is nice  

**--TODO--**  
Add stimuli processing capabilities  
Add a GUI  
Figure out what stimuli are worth working with  
Add interactivity: hunger, interaction  
Change states based off of emotion level  


**--FUTURE--**  
Machine learning for calculating modifier values?  
Neural Nets for processing stimuli into consumable data?
